# MongoDB ObjectID Integration Fix

This update addresses the issue where the frontend was unable to properly handle MongoDB ObjectIDs used by the backend. The problem was occurring because:

1. The frontend was using numeric IDs like "1", "2", "3" in local data
2. The backend was using MongoDB ObjectIDs like "67c3108c201d0fa87f6145a0"
3. The ProductMenu component was looking for restaurants by ID but couldn't find them when given a MongoDB ObjectID

## Changes Made:

### 1. Added Restaurant ID Mapper Utility
- Created `restaurantIdMapper.js` to handle mapping between different ID formats
- Added functions to find restaurants by either numeric ID or MongoDB ObjectID
- Implemented data enhancement to merge local and API data

### 2. Updated ProductMenu Component
- Improved error handling and loading states
- Added logic to find restaurants by both ID formats
- Enhanced data transformation to handle API responses better
- Added fallbacks when API data is incomplete

### 3. Updated FirmCollections and Chains Components
- Improved handling of MongoDB ObjectIDs in restaurant links
- Enhanced data merging to prevent duplicate restaurants
- Added loading states and error handling

### 4. Added Loading and Error UI
- Created loading spinners for better user experience
- Added error messages when restaurants can't be found
- Implemented "Back to Home" button for error recovery

## How to Test:

1. Start the backend server:
```
cd backend
npm run dev
```

2. Start the frontend server:
```
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

3. Test clicking on restaurants with both numeric IDs and MongoDB ObjectIDs:
   - The regular restaurants from local data should work
   - The newly created restaurants with MongoDB ObjectIDs should also work
   - The ProductMenu should display correctly for all restaurants

## Additional Notes:

- The system now prioritizes finding restaurants in local data first for speed
- API data is used to enhance and supplement local data
- If a restaurant can't be found in either source, a clear error message is shown
- Loading states provide feedback during API requests

This update ensures seamless integration between the frontend and backend regardless of the ID format used.
