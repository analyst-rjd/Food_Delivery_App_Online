## Testing

To verify the CORS fix is working:

1. Visit the CORS test endpoint: `https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/api/cors-test`
2. Check the browser console for any CORS-related errors
3. Verify that API requests are completing successfully
4. Test the vendor registration and login functionality

If you encounter any issues, check that the CORS_ORIGIN environment variable exactly matches your frontend URL, including the protocol (https://).
