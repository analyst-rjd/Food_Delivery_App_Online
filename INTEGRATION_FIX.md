# Food Delivery App - Integration Fix

This guide explains how we've fixed the integration issues between the frontend and backend of the Food Delivery App.

## The Problem

The main issue was that the frontend was using numeric IDs (like "1", "2", "3") for restaurants, but MongoDB requires ObjectId format. This caused "Cast to ObjectId failed" errors when trying to fetch restaurant data.

## What We Fixed

1. **Backend Routes**:
   - Updated restaurant routes to handle both numeric IDs and ObjectId format
   - Added support for finding restaurants by name when using numeric IDs
   - Enhanced error handling for ID format issues

2. **Database Models**:
   - Added `legacyId` and `numericId` fields to the Restaurant model
   - Modified the Item model to support different restaurant reference formats
   - Added validation for ID formats

3. **Seed Script**:
   - Updated the seed data to include numeric IDs for frontend compatibility
   - Added all restaurants from the frontend data to ensure consistency
   - Added menu items for all restaurants

## How to Use

1. **Seed the Database**:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm run seed
   ```

2. **Start the Backend**:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Start the Frontend** (in a separate terminal):
   ```
   cd ../frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the App**:
   - Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5173

## Technical Details

- The backend now checks for both numeric IDs and ObjectId format when fetching restaurants
- For numeric IDs, it tries to find the restaurant by:
  1. Matching the `legacyId` or `numericId` field
  2. Looking up the restaurant name from a mapping of known frontend IDs
  3. Using the restaurant name to find the actual database entry
- This ensures backward compatibility with the frontend's numeric ID system

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the backend console for detailed error messages
2. Verify that the database has been properly seeded
3. Ensure the frontend is using the correct API URL (check api.js)
4. If images aren't loading, the app will use fallback images automatically

## Next Steps

Now that the integration is fixed, you can:
1. Add more restaurants and menu items through the vendor interface
2. Enhance the frontend UI with additional features
3. Implement user authentication and order processing
